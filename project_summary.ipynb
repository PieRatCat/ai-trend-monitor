    "This project uses cost-effective Azure service tiers appropriate for learning and demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure Blob Storage** - Pay-as-you-go\n",
    "- Current usage: ~50KB for 150 articles (compact JSON)\n",
    "- Cost: Minimal (pennies per month for storage + transactions)\n",
    "- Rationale: Actual usage-based pricing, scales efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Language** - Standard tier (S)\n",
    "- Limits: 1,000 calls per minute\n",
    "- Current usage: ~1-5 documents per pipeline run (after deduplication)\n",
    "- Cost: Pay-per-transaction pricing\n",
    "- **Why Standard**: Exceeded Free tier's 5,000 transactions/month during testing phase\n",
    "- Rationale: Early deduplication and content filtering keep ongoing costs low\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Search** - Free tier (F)\n",
    "- Capacity: 50 MB storage, 3 indexes, 10,000 documents\n",
    "- Limitations: \n",
    "  - No semantic search (requires Basic tier or higher)\n",
    "  - 1 replica, max 1 partition, max 1 search unit\n",
    "- Current usage: 150 documents indexed (~few MB)\n",
    "- Cost: **$0/month**\n",
    "- Rationale: Well within free tier limits, sufficient for keyword search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Accumulated Cost**: 65 SEK (~$6 USD)\n",
    "- Budget alert set at: 200 SEK (~$19 USD)\n",
    "- Monthly projection: Within reasonable limits for learning project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Cost Optimization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Early URL Deduplication**\n",
    "- Prevents redundant Azure AI Language calls\n",
    "- Saves ~130 unnecessary API calls per pipeline run\n",
    "- Result: Despite Standard tier, costs remain minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Content Filtering**\n",
    "- Articles with <100 characters skipped before analysis\n",
    "- Avoids wasted API calls on empty content\n",
    "- Further reduces transaction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Compact Storage**\n",
    "- JSON stored without indentation (30-40% space savings)\n",
    "- Keeps blob storage costs negligible\n",
    "- More efficient data transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Batched Processing**\n",
    "- Azure AI Language processes 25 documents at once\n",
    "- Reduces API overhead\n",
    "- More efficient use of rate limits\n",

    "#### Production Upgrade Path\n",
    "\n",
    "For a production deployment serving real users, consider these upgrades:\n",

    "**Azure AI Search: Free → Basic (~$75/month) or Standard S1 (~$250/month)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Basic Tier Benefits:*\n",
    "- 2 GB storage (vs. 50 MB)\n",
    "- 15 indexes (vs. 3)\n",

    "- 99.9% SLA\n",
    "- Still no semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "*Standard S1 Benefits (additional):*\n",
    "- **Semantic search**: AI-powered query understanding\n",
    "  - Natural language questions instead of keywords\n",
    "  - Better relevance ranking with @search.reranker_score\n",
    "  - Example: \"Which companies invest in AI?\" understands intent\n",
    "- 25 GB storage\n",
    "- Higher throughput (more queries per second)\n",
    "- Multiple replicas and partitions for scale\n",
    "\n",
    "*When to upgrade:*\n",
    "- Dataset grows beyond 50 MB or 10,000 documents\n",
    "- Need production SLA (99.9% uptime)\n",
    "- Want semantic search for chatbot (Standard S1)\n",
    "- Require higher query throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Language: Already on Standard (optimal)**\n",
    "- Current tier sufficient for production scale\n",
    "- 1,000 calls/minute handles high throughput\n",
    "- Pay-per-use model scales with actual usage\n",
    "- No upgrade needed unless custom models required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure OpenAI Service Integration (Phase 4)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Estimated cost:* ~$50-200/month depending on usage\n",
    "- GPT-4 for conversational responses\n",
    "- Embedding models for vector search (alternative to semantic search)\n",
    "- Smart keyword extraction from natural language queries\n",
    "\n",
    "*Smart production strategy without expensive semantic search:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "User question: \"What are AI ethics concerns?\"\n",

    "- Azure Blob Storage: Pay-as-you-go - Pennies/month\n",
    "- **Total monthly projection**: ~$10-15 USD with optimizations\n",
    "- **Budget alert**: 200 SEK (~$19 USD) - comfortable safety margin\n",
    "- **Verdict**: ✅ Optimal for learning project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Scenario 1: Basic Search + OpenAI** (recommended):\n",
    "- Monthly cost: ~$75-125 (Basic Search) + ~$50-100 (OpenAI) = ~$125-225\n",
    "- Capabilities: Conversational queries via GPT-4 keyword extraction\n",
    "- Trade-offs: No native semantic ranking, but smart keyword extraction compensates\n",
    "- **Verdict**: ⭐ Best value - premium experience at mid-tier cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Scenario 2: Standard S1 Search** (premium):\n",
    "- Monthly cost: ~$250 (Standard S1) + ~$50-100 (OpenAI) = ~$300-350\n",
    "- Capabilities: Full semantic search + conversational interface\n",
    "- Trade-offs: Higher cost, native semantic understanding\n",
    "- **Verdict**: Upgrade when user demand and budget justify investment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lessons Learned: Cost Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Free Tier Limits Are Real**\n",
    "- Exceeded Azure AI Language free tier (5K/month) during testing\n",
    "- Learning: Test thoroughly but monitor usage carefully\n",
    "- Solution: Moved to Standard tier early, implemented optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Optimization Impact on Costs**\n",
    "- Early deduplication: Saves ~130 API calls per run\n",
    "- Content filtering: Prevents empty document analysis\n",
    "- Result: Standard tier costs remain minimal despite higher limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Budget Alerts Are Essential**\n",
    "- Set at 200 SEK to prevent unexpected charges\n",
    "- Provides early warning if costs spike\n",
    "- Peace of mind for experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Free Tier is Viable for Search**\n",
    "- 50 MB sufficient for thousands of articles (with compact JSON)\n",
    "- 10,000 document limit far exceeds current 150 articles\n",
    "- Keyword search works well for most use cases\n",
    "- Demonstrates: Not all services need paid tiers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "The current architecture demonstrates:\n",
    "1. **Cost-conscious engineering** - Optimization reduces API calls to keep Standard tier affordable\n",
    "2. **Scalability awareness** - Free Search tier has room to grow; easy upgrade path identified\n",
    "3. **Production readiness** - Core functionality works at any tier\n",
    "4. **Smart trade-offs** - Mix of free and paid tiers based on actual needs\n",
    "5. **Budget discipline** - Monitoring and alerts prevent cost overruns\n",
    "\n",
    "This tier strategy shows **professional cost management**: using paid services only when necessary, optimizing to minimize costs, and planning for scalable upgrades."

    "**Major Accomplishments**:\n",
    "1. ✅ Fixed chart sizing and positioning issues\n",
    "2. ✅ Optimized metrics row for better insights\n",
    "3. ✅ Improved content layout with constrained widths\n",
    "4. ✅ Documented responsive design issues for next session\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.2 Chart Layout Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Initial attempt to place bottom charts side-by-side created alignment issues\n",
    "- Entity selection controls caused vertical misalignment\n",
    "- Search bar expanded to full width across both columns\n",
    "- Charts were too large, taking entire page width\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Restored vertical stacking with better sizing\n",
    "- Both Topic Trend Timeline and Net Sentiment Distribution now stack vertically\n",
    "- Each chart wrapped in `st.columns([2, 1])` layout - takes 2/3 page width\n",
    "- Entity selection (dropdown + text input) properly scoped to Topic Trend Timeline only\n",
    "- All related content (descriptions, charts, metrics) wrapped in left column for cleaner layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Details**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Content constrained to left 2/3 of page\n",
    "col_content, col_spacer = st.columns([2, 1])\n",
    "with col_content:\n",
    "    # Description, chart, metrics all inside this column\n",
    "    # Right 1/3 remains empty for visual breathing room\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chart Sizes**:\n",
    "- Top row charts: `figsize=(3.5, 3)` - compact 3-column layout\n",
    "- Bottom charts: `figsize=(8, 4)` - readable but not overwhelming\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.3 Metrics Row Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Metrics** (redundant/unhelpful):\n",
    "1. Total Articles ✅\n",
    "2. Data Sources ✅\n",
    "3. Positive Sentiment ❌ (duplicated pie chart info)\n",
    "4. Avg Positive Score ❌ (too technical)\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Metrics** (informative/actionable):\n",
    "1. **Total Articles** - Dataset size (150)\n",
    "2. **Data Sources** - Source diversity count\n",
    "3. **Earliest Article** - \"Sep 01, 2024\" format\n",
    "4. **Latest Article** - \"Oct 15, 2024\" format  \n",
    "5. **Avg Net Sentiment** - Overall bias (-1 to +1) with \"Positive/Negative/Neutral lean\" label\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- No redundancy with visualizations\n",
    "- Clear temporal coverage (earliest to latest dates)\n",
    "- Overall sentiment direction at a glance\n",
    "- 5 metrics instead of 4 for better information density\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.4 Layout Structure (Final State)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytics Page Organization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Metrics Row** (5 columns)\n",
    "   - Total Articles | Data Sources | Earliest | Latest | Avg Net Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top Visualizations** (3 columns, compact)\n",
    "   - Sentiment Distribution (pie chart)\n",
    "   - Articles by Source (stacked bar)\n",
    "   - Articles Over Time (cumulative area chart)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Middle Section** (2 columns [1.5, 1])\n",
    "   - Word Cloud (60%) | Top 10 Topics HTML Table (40%)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Topic Trend Timeline** (constrained to 2/3 width)\n",
    "   - Description\n",
    "   - Entity selection (dropdown + text input in sub-columns [2,1])\n",
    "   - Dual-line chart (article count + net sentiment)\n",
    "   - 4 metrics (Total Articles, Positive %, Negative %, Date Range)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Net Sentiment Distribution** (constrained to 2/3 width)\n",
    "   - Description\n",
    "   - Gradient histogram with KDE overlay\n",
    "   - 4 metrics (Leaning Negative %, Leaning Positive %, Mean, Median)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.5 Key Technical Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Width Strategy**:\n",
    "- Wrapped charts in `st.columns([2, 1])` instead of using `col_chart, col_spacer` inline\n",
    "- Moved chart display and metrics inside content column\n",
    "- Provides consistent 2/3 width for both major bottom charts\n",
    "- Improves readability by preventing full-page stretch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date Handling**:\n",
    "- Uses `published_date` with `indexed_at` fallback throughout\n",
    "- Format: `%b %d, %Y` (e.g., \"Oct 15, 2025\") for compact display\n",
    "- Consistent date parsing: `pd.to_datetime()` with `errors='coerce'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indentation Management**:\n",
    "- Careful Python indentation required when nesting Streamlit column contexts\n",
    "- All content within `with col_content:` block properly indented (4 spaces)\n",
    "- Metrics use sub-columns within main content column\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.6 Known Issues & Next Session Priority\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚨 CRITICAL: Responsive Design Issues**\n",

    "## 12. Session 35 - Phase 4: Analytics Page Layout Optimization (October 16, 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.1 Session Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: Continuing Phase 4 (Interactive Web Dashboard) development - Session 35 focused on optimizing the Analytics page layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Optimize Analytics page layout for better space utilization, readability, and visual hierarchy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starting Point**: Analytics page had scattered improvements but suffered from:\n",
    "- Topic Trend Timeline constrained to 60% width (40% wasted white space)\n",
    "- Net Sentiment Distribution also at 60% width (inconsistent layout)\n",
    "- Small, hard-to-read fonts in tables and legends\n",
    "- Misleading green delta indicators on metrics (suggested trends where none existed)\n",
    "- Sentiment bars in counterintuitive order (Positive first, Negative last)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Clean, professional Priority-Based Layout with optimal space usage and improved UX\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.2 Major Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2.1 Fixed Indentation Cascade (Critical Bug Fix)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Attempted to remove `col_content, col_spacer = st.columns([2, 1])` container from Topic Trend Timeline to achieve full width, but created massive indentation errors across 120+ lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Attempts**:\n",
    "- Manual line-by-line fixes → Created elif/else alignment errors\n",
    "- Python script with uniform indentation reduction → Broke if/elif/else block structure\n",
    "- File ended up with 6 compile errors, Analytics page couldn't load\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "1. Fixed `if viz_mode ==` statement that was mistakenly outside its parent block\n",
    "2. Properly aligned all if/elif/elif chains (must be at exact same column)\n",
    "3. Fixed indentation in metrics section (`with col_a/b/c/d:` blocks)\n",
    "4. Ensured else clause aligned with corresponding if statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lines Affected**: 799-958 (Topic Trend Timeline visualization logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: ✅ All 6 compile errors resolved, Topic Trend Timeline now renders at full width\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2.2 Implemented Priority-Based Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Request**: \"Propose how to rearrange this page most optimally\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Presented**:\n",
    "- Row 1: Topic Trend Timeline (60% + 40% empty)\n",
    "- Row 2: Net Sentiment Distribution (60% + 40% empty)\n",
    "- Row 3: Source Statistics table (66%) + Growth (33%)\n",
    "- Row 4: Word Cloud (60%) + Top 10 Topics (40%)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems Identified**:\n",
    "- 40% horizontal white space wasted in rows 1-2\n",
    "- Inconsistent column ratios across rows\n",
    "- Charts unnecessarily stretched vertically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Three Options Proposed**:\n",
    "1. Full-Width Everything (all charts span 100%, vertical scroll)\n",
    "2. **Priority-Based Layout** (selected by user)\n",
    "3. Balanced Grid (all rows 50/50 split)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selected: Option 2 - Priority-Based Layout**\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Structure**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Row 1: [===== Topic Trend Timeline (100%) =====]\n",
    "Row 2: [Net Sentiment (55%)][Source Stats+Growth (45%)]\n",
    "Row 3: [===== Word Cloud (60%) =====][Top 10 (40%)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- Emphasizes most important visualization (Topic Trend Timeline at full width)\n",
    "- Eliminates wasted space (no empty 40% columns)\n",
    "- Balanced lower rows with appropriate column ratios\n",
    "- Better information density without feeling cramped\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2.3 Font Size Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changes Made**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Source Statistics Table**:\n",
    "   - Table body: 13px → **16px** (match description text baseline)\n",
    "   - Table headers: 12px → **15px** (proportionally larger)\n",
    "   - Cell padding: 8px 10px → **10px 12px** (breathing room)\n",
    "   - Sentiment bar height: 18px → **24px** (accommodate larger labels)\n",
    "   - Bar segment labels: 9px → **13px** (article counts inside bars)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Legend Below Table**:\n",
    "   - Font size: 11px → **16px**\n",
    "   - Now readable without squinting\n",
    "   - Color dots with Negative → Neutral → Positive → Mixed labels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: All text meets 16px minimum baseline for readability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2.4 Removed Misleading Delta Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Streamlit's `st.metric()` third parameter (delta) displays with green/red arrows and clashing colors:\n",
    "- Green upward arrows on \"articles\" and \"Negative lean\" looked like positive trends\n",
    "- Color didn't match dashboard's professional tan/teal/olive palette\n",
    "- Arrows suggested changes over time when metrics were static snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "**Locations Fixed**:\n",
    "1. **Topic Trend Timeline metrics** (2 metrics):\n",
    "   - Before: `st.metric(\"Positive\", f\"{positive_pct:.1f}%\", f\"{positive_count} articles\")`\n",
    "   - After: `st.metric(\"Positive\", f\"{positive_pct:.1f}% ({positive_count} articles)\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Net Sentiment Distribution metrics** (6 metrics):\n",
    "   - Positive, Neutral, Negative, Mixed, Leaning Positive, Leaning Negative\n",
    "   - Same fix: moved article counts into value parameter with parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Growth Overview - Latest Month**:\n",
    "   - Before: `st.metric(\"Latest Month\", f\"{recent_month}\", f\"{growth:+d} ({growth_pct:+.0f}%)\")`\n",
    "   - After: `st.metric(\"Latest Month\", f\"{recent_month} ({growth:+d}, {growth_pct:+.0f}%)\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sidebar - Avg Net Sentiment**:\n",
    "   - Before: `st.metric(\"Avg Net Sentiment\", f\"{avg_net_sentiment:.3f}\", delta_label)`\n",
    "   - After: `st.metric(\"Avg Net Sentiment\", f\"{avg_net_sentiment:.3f} ({delta_label})\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Clean, professional metrics without confusing arrows or clashing colors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2.5 Chart Dimension Adjustments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic Trend Timeline**:\n",
    "- Original: 8\" wide x 4\" tall (constrained by 60% column)\n",
    "- Intermediate: 10\" x 3\" (full width, too short)\n",
    "- Final: **10\" x 3.5\"** (optimal balance)\n",
    "- Rationale: Full width utilization, entire section (header → metrics) fits on screen without scrolling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Net Sentiment Distribution**:\n",
    "- Original: 8\" x 4\" (full-width section)\n",
    "- Final: **6\" x 3.5\"** (adjusted for 55% column)\n",
    "- Rationale: Fits left column of row 2, maintains readability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2.6 Sentiment Bar Reordering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Bars showed Positive → Neutral → Negative → Mixed (left to right), which is counterintuitive. Readers naturally expect negative on left, positive on right.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**:\n",
    "- Reordered bars: **Negative → Neutral → Positive → Mixed**\n",
    "- Updated legend to match new order\n",
    "- Applied to Source Statistics table sentiment distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Change** (lines 1207-1218):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Build sentiment bar (ordered: Negative → Neutral → Positive → Mixed)\n",
    "sentiment_bar = '<div class=\"sentiment-bar\">'\n",
    "if neg > 0:\n",
    "    sentiment_bar += f'<div class=\"sentiment-segment\" style=\"width: {neg_pct}%; background-color: #C17D3D;\">{neg}</div>'\n",
    "if neu > 0:\n",
    "    sentiment_bar += f'<div class=\"sentiment-segment\" style=\"width: {neu_pct}%; background-color: #8B9D83;\">{neu}</div>'\n",
    "if pos > 0:\n",
    "    sentiment_bar += f'<div class=\"sentiment-segment\" style=\"width: {pos_pct}%; background-color: #5C9AA5;\">{pos}</div>'\n",
    "if mix > 0:\n",
    "    sentiment_bar += f'<div class=\"sentiment-segment\" style=\"width: {mix_pct}%; background-color: #B8A893;\">{mix}</div>'\n",
    "sentiment_bar += '</div>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Natural left-to-right reading (negative sentiment → positive sentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12.2.7 Data Filtering - June 1, 2025 Cutoff\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Conducted**: Ran `analyze_dates.py` to examine article distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Total articles: 150\n",

    "**Required Improvements**:\n",
    "1. Font scaling for smaller viewports (headers, metrics, body text)\n",
    "2. Column stacking on mobile/tablet (convert 2-column rows to vertical stack)\n",
    "3. Chart responsiveness (adjust dimensions based on screen width)\n",

    "**Best Practices Demonstrated**:\n",
    "1. **User-Centered Design**: Proposed multiple layout options with clear tradeoffs\n",
    "2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Analyzed article distribution before implementing filters\n",
    "3. **Iterative Refinement**: Fixed indentation bug, adjusted chart heights, tweaked fonts\n",
    "4. **Professional Polish**: Removed misleading UI elements (deltas), fixed unintuitive ordering\n",
    "5. **Documentation Discipline**: Updated both Copilot instructions and project notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Lessons**:\n",
    "1. Large indentation fixes require structure-aware approach (not just uniform space reduction)\n",
    "2. Streamlit metrics' third parameter (delta) should be avoided for static snapshots\n",
    "3. HTML tables in Streamlit need careful CSS for readability (font sizes, padding, bar heights)\n",
    "4. Date filtering should happen at multiple points (data retrieval + search results)\n",
    "5. Chart dimensions need tuning for different column widths (10x3.5 full, 6x3.5 half)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Project Status** (Major Phases):\n",
    "- ✅ **Phase 1**: Data Pipeline (Guardian API + 4 RSS feeds)\n",
    "- ✅ **Phase 2**: NLP Analysis (Azure AI Language)\n",
    "- ✅ **Phase 3**: Knowledge Mining (Azure AI Search - 150 articles indexed)\n",
    "- 🚧 **Phase 4**: Interactive Web Dashboard (95% complete - responsive design remains)\n",

    "## 13. Session 36 - Phase 5: Chatbot Date Filtering & Token Management (October 16, 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Development session within Phase 5 (RAG Chatbot) focused on fixing date filtering issues and implementing smart token budget management.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.1 Session Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**: After completing Session 35's Analytics page optimizations, user ran the pipeline and added 29 new articles (150 → 179 total). Testing the chatbot revealed critical issues with date filtering and token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems Discovered**:\n",
    "1. Guardian API repeatedly fetching old articles (Dec 2023) with no date filter\n",
    "2. Chatbot incorrectly reporting \"only 1 article in last 24 hours\" when 29 were just added\n",
    "3. Chatbot citing Dec 22, 2023 article despite June 1, 2025 cutoff\n",
    "4. Token limit errors (413) when retrieving 15 articles for queries like \"What happened in 2023?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause**: Date filtering was only applied in dashboard Analytics page, not at the data source (Guardian API) or chatbot RAG retrieval layer. This caused inefficient processing and stale data pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Implement comprehensive date filtering at all levels + smart token budget management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.2 Guardian API Date Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: Guardian API fetched all articles matching query regardless of publication date, including Dec 22, 2023 article on every pipeline run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation** (`src/api_fetcher.py`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "params = {\n",
    "    'api-key': api_key,\n",
    "    'q': query_string,\n",
    "    'from-date': '2025-06-01',  # Only fetch articles from June 1, 2025 onwards\n",
    "    'page-size': 50\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact**:\n",
    "- Prevents fetching articles before June 1, 2025 at source\n",
    "- Saves API quota (no wasted requests)\n",
    "- Reduces scraping time (fewer articles to process)\n",
    "- Eliminates wasted Azure AI Language analysis costs\n",
    "- Stops stale articles from entering the index\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: Dec 2023 article no longer fetched on pipeline runs ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.3 Chatbot Temporal Query Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: When user asked \"Summarize news from the last 24 hours\", chatbot did semantic search without understanding the temporal constraint. It retrieved articles from weeks ago that mentioned \"24 hours\" in content.\n",

    "- \"last X days\" (dynamic number extraction)\n",

    "→ Detected: \"last 24 hours\"\n",
    "→ Cutoff: 2025-10-15 21:12:18\n",
    "→ Retrieves: Only articles >= Oct 15, 2025 21:12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.4 Azure AI Search Ordering Fix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: When temporal query detected, chatbot used `search_text=\"*\"` to retrieve all articles, but Azure AI Search returned them in random order (not by date). Checking first 50 results found no recent articles, even though 17 from today existed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Example**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Requested: top=50 articles with search_text=\"*\"\n",
    "Received: Articles from Aug 8, June 7, Oct 9, Oct 8, Oct 11 (random order)\n",
    "Result: 0 articles passed date filter (no recent ones in first 50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Use `order_by` parameter to sort by date descending.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation** (`src/rag_chatbot.py`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "search_params = {\n",
    "    \"search_text\": search_text,\n",
    "    \"select\": [\"title\", \"content\", \"source\", \"published_date\", \"link\"]\n",

    "    search_params[\"top\"] = top_k * 3\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 13.6 Chatbot Settings Update\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue**: Default slider value of 5 articles insufficient for temporal queries like \"last 24 hours\" (17 articles available).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changes** (`streamlit_app/app.py`):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Setting | Old Value | New Value | Rationale |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n",
    "| **Default articles** | 5 | 15 | Better for comprehensive summaries |\n",
    "| **Max articles** | 10 | 20 | Allows exhaustive temporal coverage |\n",
    "| **Min articles** | 3 | 5 | Ensures sufficient context |\n",
    "| **Help text** | \"Number of relevant articles to use as context\" | \"Number of relevant articles to use as context. For temporal queries (e.g., 'last 24 hours'), more articles = more comprehensive summary.\" | Explains temporal use case |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact**:\n",
    "- Users get comprehensive summaries by default\n",
    "- \"Last 24 hours\" query retrieves 15 articles (up from 5)\n",
    "- Can still adjust down to 5 for brief answers\n",
    "- Can increase to 20 for exhaustive coverage\n",

    "### 13.9 Results & Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before Session 36**:\n",
    "- Guardian API: Fetches all historical articles (no date filter)\n",
    "- Chatbot temporal queries: Semantic search only (no date awareness)\n",
    "- Token limit: Fixed 1500 chars/article, frequent 413 errors with 15 articles\n",
    "- Default retrieval: 5 articles (insufficient for temporal queries)\n",
    "- Issues: Dec 2023 article appearing, inaccurate \"last 24 hours\" responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**After Session 36**:\n",
    "- Guardian API: ✅ Filters at source (`from-date: 2025-06-01`)\n",
    "- Chatbot temporal queries: ✅ Detects phrases, applies date filters, orders by date\n",
    "- Token limit: ✅ Smart budget management (5000 tokens default, 3500 with history)\n",
    "- Default retrieval: ✅ 15 articles (comprehensive coverage)\n",
    "- Issues resolved: ✅ No stale articles, accurate temporal responses, no 413 errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Impact**:\n",
    "- Pipeline efficiency: ~2 min saved per run (no old article processing)\n",
    "- Azure AI costs: Reduced (no wasted analysis on filtered articles)\n",
    "- Chatbot accuracy: 100% correct date filtering (17/17 articles for \"last 24 hours\")\n",
    "- User experience: No token errors, comprehensive summaries by default\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.10 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture Lessons**:\n",
    "1. **Filter at Source**: Apply date constraints at API level, not post-processing\n",
    "2. **Multi-Layer Filtering**: Guardian API → Dashboard → Chatbot (defense in depth)\n",
    "3. **Smart Retrieval**: Use `order_by` for efficient temporal queries\n",
    "4. **Token Budget Management**: Dynamic content truncation based on article count\n",
    "5. **Context-Aware Defaults**: More articles for temporal queries (15 vs 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Insights**:\n",
    "1. Azure AI Search doesn't sort by date by default (`order_by` required)\n",
    "2. Temporal query detection needs regex patterns, not semantic matching\n",
    "3. Conversation history consumes ~1500 tokens (reduce context budget accordingly)\n",
    "4. Token estimate: 1 token ≈ 4 characters (rule of thumb for English text)\n",
    "5. GitHub Models free tier: 8000 token limit (5000 for context is safe)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices**:\n",
    "1. **Test with Real Queries**: User's \"last 24 hours\" query revealed the issues\n",
    "2. **Debug with Visibility**: Log token calculations and cutoff dates\n",
    "3. **Incremental Validation**: Test each fix independently before integration\n",
    "4. **Move Test Files**: Keep project root clean (utilities directory)\n",
    "5. **Document Immediately**: Update instructions while context is fresh\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 5 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**\n",
    "- RAG chatbot fully functional with GitHub Models (GPT-4.1-mini)\n",
    "- Temporal query detection and date filtering operational\n",
    "- Token budget management prevents errors\n",
    "- Comprehensive date filtering across all system layers\n",
    "- Ready for production use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Project Status** (Major Phases):\n",
    "- ✅ **Phase 1**: Data Pipeline (Guardian API + RSS feeds with date filtering)\n",
    "- ✅ **Phase 2**: NLP Analysis (Azure AI Language batched processing)\n",
    "- ✅ **Phase 3**: Knowledge Mining (Azure AI Search - 184 articles indexed)\n",
    "- 🚧 **Phase 4**: Interactive Web Dashboard (95% complete - responsive design remains)\n",
    "- ✅ **Phase 5**: RAG Chatbot (COMPLETE - temporal queries + token management)\n",
    "- 📋 **Phase 6**: Automated Reports (Planned - GPT-4.1-mini weekly summaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Milestone**: Complete responsive design for Phase 4, then proceed to Phase 6 automated weekly report generation."
