    "### 5.4 Azure Service Tier Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current Configuration: Free/Standard Tiers\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses cost-effective Azure service tiers appropriate for learning and demonstration:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure Blob Storage** - Pay-as-you-go\n",
    "- Current usage: ~50KB for 150 articles (compact JSON)\n",
    "- Cost: Minimal (pennies per month for storage + transactions)\n",
    "- Rationale: Actual usage-based pricing, scales efficiently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Language** - Standard tier (S)\n",
    "- Limits: 1,000 calls per minute\n",
    "- Current usage: ~1-5 documents per pipeline run (after deduplication)\n",
    "- Cost: Pay-per-transaction pricing\n",
    "- **Why Standard**: Exceeded Free tier's 5,000 transactions/month during testing phase\n",
    "- Rationale: Early deduplication and content filtering keep ongoing costs low\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Search** - Free tier (F)\n",
    "- Capacity: 50 MB storage, 3 indexes, 10,000 documents\n",
    "- Limitations: \n",
    "  - No semantic search (requires Basic tier or higher)\n",
    "  - 1 replica, max 1 partition, max 1 search unit\n",
    "- Current usage: 150 documents indexed (~few MB)\n",
    "- Cost: **$0/month**\n",
    "- Rationale: Well within free tier limits, sufficient for keyword search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Accumulated Cost**: 65 SEK (~$6 USD)\n",
    "- Budget alert set at: 200 SEK (~$19 USD)\n",
    "- Monthly projection: Within reasonable limits for learning project\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Cost Optimization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Early URL Deduplication**\n",
    "- Prevents redundant Azure AI Language calls\n",
    "- Saves ~130 unnecessary API calls per pipeline run\n",
    "- Result: Despite Standard tier, costs remain minimal\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Content Filtering**\n",
    "- Articles with <100 characters skipped before analysis\n",
    "- Avoids wasted API calls on empty content\n",
    "- Further reduces transaction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Compact Storage**\n",
    "- JSON stored without indentation (30-40% space savings)\n",
    "- Keeps blob storage costs negligible\n",
    "- More efficient data transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Batched Processing**\n",
    "- Azure AI Language processes 25 documents at once\n",
    "- Reduces API overhead\n",
    "- More efficient use of rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production Upgrade Path\n",
    "\n",
    "For a production deployment serving real users, consider these upgrades:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Search: Free → Basic (~$75/month) or Standard S1 (~$250/month)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Basic Tier Benefits:*\n",
    "- 2 GB storage (vs. 50 MB)\n",
    "- 15 indexes (vs. 3)\n",
    "- 1 million documents (vs. 10,000)\n",
    "- 99.9% SLA\n",
    "- Still no semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "*Standard S1 Benefits (additional):*\n",
    "- **Semantic search**: AI-powered query understanding\n",
    "  - Natural language questions instead of keywords\n",
    "  - Better relevance ranking with @search.reranker_score\n",
    "  - Example: \"Which companies invest in AI?\" understands intent\n",
    "- 25 GB storage\n",
    "- Higher throughput (more queries per second)\n",
    "- Multiple replicas and partitions for scale\n",
    "\n",
    "*When to upgrade:*\n",
    "- Dataset grows beyond 50 MB or 10,000 documents\n",
    "- Need production SLA (99.9% uptime)\n",
    "- Want semantic search for chatbot (Standard S1)\n",
    "- Require higher query throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Language: Already on Standard (optimal)**\n",
    "- Current tier sufficient for production scale\n",
    "- 1,000 calls/minute handles high throughput\n",
    "- Pay-per-use model scales with actual usage\n",
    "- No upgrade needed unless custom models required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure OpenAI Service Integration (Phase 4)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Estimated cost:* ~$50-200/month depending on usage\n",
    "- GPT-4 for conversational responses\n",
    "- Embedding models for vector search (alternative to semantic search)\n",
    "- Smart keyword extraction from natural language queries\n",
    "\n",
    "*Smart production strategy without expensive semantic search:*\n",
    "```\n",
    "User question: \"What are AI ethics concerns?\"\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Azure OpenAI: Extract keywords → [\"AI\", \"ethics\", \"concerns\", \"safety\", \"regulation\"]\n",

    "\n",
    "**Current Setup (Learning/Demonstration)**:\n",
    "- Azure AI Search: Free tier - $0/month\n",
    "- Azure AI Language: Standard tier - Pay-per-use (~65 SEK accumulated)\n",
    "- Azure Blob Storage: Pay-as-you-go - Pennies/month\n",
    "- **Total monthly projection**: ~$10-15 USD with optimizations\n",
    "- **Budget alert**: 200 SEK (~$19 USD) - comfortable safety margin\n",
    "- **Verdict**: ✅ Optimal for learning project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Scenario 1: Basic Search + OpenAI** (recommended):\n",
    "- Monthly cost: ~$75-125 (Basic Search) + ~$50-100 (OpenAI) = ~$125-225\n",
    "- Capabilities: Conversational queries via GPT-4 keyword extraction\n",
    "- Trade-offs: No native semantic ranking, but smart keyword extraction compensates\n",
    "- **Verdict**: ⭐ Best value - premium experience at mid-tier cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Scenario 2: Standard S1 Search** (premium):\n",
    "- Monthly cost: ~$250 (Standard S1) + ~$50-100 (OpenAI) = ~$300-350\n",
    "- Capabilities: Full semantic search + conversational interface\n",
    "- Trade-offs: Higher cost, native semantic understanding\n",
    "- **Verdict**: Upgrade when user demand and budget justify investment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lessons Learned: Cost Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Free Tier Limits Are Real**\n",
    "- Exceeded Azure AI Language free tier (5K/month) during testing\n",
    "- Learning: Test thoroughly but monitor usage carefully\n",
    "- Solution: Moved to Standard tier early, implemented optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Optimization Impact on Costs**\n",
    "- Early deduplication: Saves ~130 API calls per run\n",
    "- Content filtering: Prevents empty document analysis\n",
    "- Result: Standard tier costs remain minimal despite higher limits\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Budget Alerts Are Essential**\n",
    "- Set at 200 SEK to prevent unexpected charges\n",
    "- Provides early warning if costs spike\n",
    "- Peace of mind for experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Free Tier is Viable for Search**\n",
    "- 50 MB sufficient for thousands of articles (with compact JSON)\n",
    "- 10,000 document limit far exceeds current 150 articles\n",
    "- Keyword search works well for most use cases\n",
    "- Demonstrates: Not all services need paid tiers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "The current architecture demonstrates:\n",
    "1. **Cost-conscious engineering** - Optimization reduces API calls to keep Standard tier affordable\n",
    "2. **Scalability awareness** - Free Search tier has room to grow; easy upgrade path identified\n",
    "3. **Production readiness** - Core functionality works at any tier\n",
    "4. **Smart trade-offs** - Mix of free and paid tiers based on actual needs\n",
    "5. **Budget discipline** - Monitoring and alerts prevent cost overruns\n",
    "\n",
    "This tier strategy shows **professional cost management**: using paid services only when necessary, optimizing to minimize costs, and planning for scalable upgrades."
